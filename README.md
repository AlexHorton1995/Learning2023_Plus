# Learning2023_Plus - A Personal repository of self propelled learning in 2023 onward!

## A Self-Guided Learning Project

Welcome to my self-guided learning project repository! This repository serves as a personal project for my journey of learning various technologies and concepts. The main focus of this project is on GIT, Microsoft SQL Server, C#, Rest APIs, and Generative AI using Chat GPT.

### Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to document my progress and learning experiences while exploring different technologies. I believe in the power of self-guided learning, and this repository acts as a journal of my journey.

Throughout the project, I will be focusing on the following technologies:

    GIT: Version control system used to manage the source code and track changes.
    Microsoft SQL Server: Relational database management system used for data storage and retrieval.
    C#: Programming language used for developing applications and interacting with various technologies.
    Rest APIs: Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture used for building web services and APIs.
    Generative AI (Chat GPT): Exploring the fascinating world of generative AI with a focus on Chat GPT models.

Each technology will have its dedicated folder within this repository, containing code samples, tutorials, and learning resources.

### Technologies Covered

#### GIT
