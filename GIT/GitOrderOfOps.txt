1a. git clone - clone the repo from the remote repository (server) to your local machine.
	* Should only have to do this one time (other factors aside)

1b. git checkout master - this puts you back on the master branch. 
	* Only do this if you have already cloned down the repo you will be using.

2. git branch - creates a working branch in which YOU will do your work.  
	* example: git branch WorkingOnAssignment

3. git checkout <branch> - checkout the branch you just created in step number 2 :)
	* git checkout WorkingOnAssignment
	
4. Perform all of your changes.

5. git status - this allows you to see what you've changed on your branch that is different from the master branch.
	* git status (changes will show in red)
	
6. git add (either do individual filenames OR git add *) 
	* the '*' wildcard adds all changed files you've made.
	
7. git commit - commits all of your staged changes to you LOCAL repository.

8. git push - this pushes your LOCAL branch up to the remote repository.
	* if you've never pushed a branch, you'll need to do git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>
